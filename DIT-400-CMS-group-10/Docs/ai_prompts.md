## AI Prompts & Usage Log  

### 1. Prompt:  
*"Convert the completed C++ Course Management System into Java using arrays only."*  

- **Accepted**: Using `Scanner` in Java instead of `cin` in C++.  
- **Rejected**: Suggestion to use `ArrayList` ‚Äî requirement was arrays only.  
- **Reasoning**: Scanner is a direct replacement for input, but ArrayList breaks the assignment constraints.

*"Explain how to build an executable JAR for the Java program."*  

- **Accepted**: `javac Main.java` and `jar cfe cms_java.jar Main Main.class`.

- **Accepted**: Splitting work into **Authentication & File I/O**, **Course CRUD**, **Search/Update & Java translation**.
